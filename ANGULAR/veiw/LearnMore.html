        <h1 id="title">Construction Workers Hub Documentation</h1>
        In some countries, there are many construction workers who are waiting under the hot <br /> blazing
        sun in a known place where a civil engineer comes by to choose some construction <br /> workers to
        work under him. <br />
        <br />
        In this Application we built called <strong>Construction Workers Hub</strong> solves this real world
        problem <br /> where the construction worker doesn’t have to wait in a specific place waiting for a
        potential <br /> job, nor does the engineer have to go to a specific place to choose the
        construction worker <br /> he needs. <br />
        <br />
        When you first open the <strong>Construction Workers Hub</strong> application you’ll see two
        buttons, one <br /> with a picture of a construction worker which takes you to the sign up page for
        the <br /> construction workers, after you sign up you’ll be directed to the sign in page then to
        your profile as a <br /> construction worker. The other button has a picture of an engineer which
        will take you to the <br /> engineer sign up page, after you sign up and sign in successfully,
        you’ll be directed to your <br /> profile as an engineer where you can click on one of the buttons
        to view all the construction <br /> workers by category, ex: stone builders button will take you to
        all the stone builder workers, <br /> which also applies to all the categories available. Once you
        click on one of the worker <br /> categories and then click on go to profile you’ll be directed to
        that worker’s profile you’ve <br /> chosen, there you can book that worker provided an end date and
        you can also message him <br /> from the application itself if you need to.
